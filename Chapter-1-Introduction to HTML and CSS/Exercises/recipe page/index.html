    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the mutton with yogurt, half the mandi spices, turmeric, cumin, garlic, and salt for at least 2 hours (overnight for best results).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat 2 tbsp ghee and oil. Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated mutton and sear on high heat for 5 minutes until browned.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, cover, and cook on low heat for 1.5-2 hours until meat is tender (add water if needed).</li>
        <li>In another pot, heat remaining ghee. Drain soaked rice and add to the pot with remaining mandi spices. Sauté for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 5 cups water and salt. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and cook covered until rice is 70% done (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked mutton in the first pot. Cover with tight lid.</li>
        <li>Cook on very low heat for 20-25 minutes (dum style) until rice is fully cooked and flavors combine.</li>
        <li>For authentic flavor, place a piece of burning charcoal in a small bowl on top of the rice, drizzle with oil, and cover for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh herbs and fried onions before serving hot with salad and yogurt sauce.</li>
    </ol>
